# Ticket scanner app support for the SilverStripe Event Tickets module

Adds support for the Ticket Scanner app, available on the [App store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xd-ticket-scanner/id1250791189) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.xd.ticketscanner), this adds a more convenient way to scan your tickets.
The app can be configured with your event ticket module. You'll need to supply your domain name and log in with your CMS user account.
